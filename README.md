The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has experienced a profound expansion in recent 
times, becoming a vital component of national critical infrastructure systems. However, this 
growth has brought about security challenges, particularly in the face of sophisticated zero-day attacks. These attacks, which exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities, pose a significant obstacle to traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) that rely on known signatures 
or rules. This study delves into the complexities of these challenges, examining their historical context, evaluating current methods, and emphasizing the necessity for advanced, realtime detection mechanisms. In conclusion, this thesis presents an innovative and robust sollution to a pressing challenge, ensuring that the IIoT can reach its full potential without being hindered by security concerns. It opens the door for future research, encouraging the 
exploration of even more advanced techniques and methodologies to safeguard our critical 
infrastructure. Through extensive experimentation with diverse datasets, our proposed system has demonstrated a substantial reduction in both false positives and false negatives, 
showcasing its superiority over conventional IDS. The results also highlight the system's 
scalability, adaptability, and proficiency in detecting zero-day attacks in real-time. Our approach encompasses a combination of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. By harnessing the capabilities of autoencoders and recurrent neural networks, we 
have developed an advanced IDS that not only identifies but also adapts to evolving attack 
strategies. Additionally, our methodology incorporates a thorough feature selection process, 
ensuring the system operates with high efficiency and minimal computational burden
